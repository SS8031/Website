            <td>
                I took upon a leadership role in college as a mentor. As a mentor I was expected to work with a junior
                class and help them. I was partnered up with another mentor and we were given a period where were
                responsible to take care of the class. We planned games with the junior class and there were times where
                we would help and talk to the class. This role also came with the responsibility of planning out
                assemblies and talking in front of a large group. I learnt a lot of skills through this role such as
                responsibility, leadership, organisation, and self-confidence.

                I was given the opportunity to be a prefect for my college in 2018. This role came with responsibilies
                like the mentor leadership however as a prefect we were expected to orgainise larger events for the
                school such as assemblies, sports day, fundrasiers etc. I orgainised the 40 hour famine which required
                me to speak infront of the school to promote 40-hour famine challenges and the cause, had to do meetings
                with orgainisers and also collect money. This role helped improve sklls such as leadership,
                organisation, responsibility and self-confidence and brought new skills such as good at communication,
                good time management and team work.

                In year 12 in college I was offered a scholarship by First Foundation. This scholarship offered me 3

                with my teriary studies and lastly work experience in the fieild I wish to pursue.

                Through this scholarship I was given the opportunity at an internship as TAB NZ as a developer and user
                tester. I was able to experience what the work field would look like before I had started university
                which was helpful to decide if this is the field I want to pursue. I worked in scrum teams and was
                expected to do daily stand up meetings and learnt how Agile works. I was exposed to the language Perl
                and how to do user testing with their website and retail machines. During this internship I fixed
                small bugs and added small functionalities to their webpaged with the languages Perl, HTML, JavaScript
                and SQL queries.
